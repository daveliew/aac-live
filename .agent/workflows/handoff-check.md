description: Mandatory pre-flight checklist to ensure adherence to project guardrails
---

Before starting any work, you MUST:

1. Read [AGENT_HANDOFF.md](file:///Users/dave/CODE/LEARNING/gemini/aac-live/AGENT_HANDOFF.md) to identify the currently assigned **Next Task**.
2. Read [CLAUDE.md](file:///Users/dave/CODE/LEARNING/gemini/aac-live/CLAUDE.md) to verify authorized model IDs, API versions, and technical specifications.
3. **DO NOT** perform any work that is not explicitly listed in the "Next Task" section of `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.
4. If you identify improvements or new features (e.g., new SDKs, UI polish), you **MUST** add them to the "Suggested Tasks" section of `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` and wait for human approval before implementing.
5. Strictly respect file ownership as defined in the "Respect File Ownership" section.
